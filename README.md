The Auto Driving Car Simulation is a command-line program that simulates the movement of autonomous cars within a rectangular field. Each car has a unique name, a starting position, and a direction it is facing. Users can define movement commands for each car, and the simulation runs step-by-step, detecting collisions and ensuring cars do not move out of bounds.

Features:
1) Define the dimensions of the simulation field.
2) Add one or more cars with unique names and initial positions.
3) Issue movement commands (L, R, F) for each car:
4 )L: Rotate left by 90 degrees.
5) R: Rotate right by 90 degrees.
6) F: Move forward by 1 grid point (if within boundaries).
7) Simulate all cars step-by-step, detecting and handling collisions.
8) View the final positions or collisions of all cars.
